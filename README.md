## Coding style conventions


Rules:

- Omit needless words
- Every word should convey what your variable/function/class is doing.
- Some file systems are not case-sensitive, so many projects require filenames to be all lowercase. Using a separating character allows names to still be readable in that form. Using underscores as the separator ensures that the name is still a valid Dart identifier, which may be helpful if the language later supports symbolic imports.
- All folder should be snake_case, example folders: models, style, floor_plan
- All files of lib (related to cross-platform apps) should be snake_case + the name of the folder (in most cases), example files: api_model, floor_plan_screen
- All files inside android and ios folders should be in UpperCamelCase (related to specific platform) + the name of the folder (in most cases), example files: FloorPlansScreen, ApiModel
- All Class names should follow UpperCamelCase rule. Example: FindTable.
